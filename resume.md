## Summary

I am an R&D engineer at ABB specialized in:

* Software Design & Development,
* UI design,
* Data Visualization,
* Machine Learning.

I am passionate about developing great products and believe strongly in basing technology development and innovation on a solid understanding of people and the social context they work in. Making products that help the users meet their goals effectively is key to drive a successful business. And great fun, too!

I have a multi-disciplinary background from both engineering and social sciences, and I've worn many hats within software development; programmer, automation software engineer, research scientist, project manager, and ux/interaction designer. This enables me to dive into complex challenges from different angles, and is a solid basis for developing innovative, efficient & engaging software user experiences.
